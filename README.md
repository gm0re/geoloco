## Set up project

To get started is necessary to process the data in `geoloco-countries-parser/countries.geojson` so the app can generate the polygon boundles for each country.

### `node geoloco-countries/index.js`

Will generate in `public/countries` the geodata processed for countries bounds, and a `constants/countries/index.json` where will be listed the available countries.
